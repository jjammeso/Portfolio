        description: "Furniture Store is an e-commerce platform tailored for the sale of furniture. This project employs a microservices architecture, dividing the application into three distinct parts: a customer user interface (UI), an administrative UI, and a backend dedicated to handling all CRUD operations. Customers can effortlessly browse products, filter by categories, and add items to their cart for purchase. Meanwhile, the administrative side allows for the addition and management of products, providing a streamlined process for inventory control. For a hands-on experience, please visit the provided link to add a new product and observe its integration into the customer frontend. I am currently in the process of enhancing the order functionalities for customers and expanding the product management features on the administrative side.",
